# Joust Duel

For our second year GPR5100 module, we are asked to make an online multyplayer game using the rollback technique. This game is being made on the Neko Engine using an already implemented rollback that we have to understand and use in order to make our game and networking work correctly. The goal is not to make a visually esthetic game or to create elaborate gameplay but rather to implement a very small, easy online multyplayer game using the rollback technique.

## What i had to do

In order for the most basic Joust Duel gameplay to be possible, i had to recreate some of the original concept of the Joust game wich are the following in this case :
- Players horizontal and vertical movement (moving,flying and falling)
- Players side respawning
- Player/Player collision
- Conditions and behavior of hit
